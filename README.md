Cross Country Salary Management System

Overview:

The Cross Country Salary Management System is a Java-based application that helps organizations manage and compare employee salaries from various countries. It stores each employee's name, country, and salary in their local currency, then converts all salaries to USD using fixed exchange rates. This provides a standardized view, making salary comparison and total cost analysis across different regions easy and efficient.
